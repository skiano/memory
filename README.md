# Memory




## Rules

* All cards begin face down.
* The player turns one card face up, and then a second.
  * If they match, the pair is removed from the game.
  * If they do not match, both cards turn back over.
* The game ends when the player finds all matching pairs.

## Game Modes

Here's the twist. You can choose from various game modes, each of which has it's own type of matching.
